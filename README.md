If youre wondering why some of the projects I have linked are in private repos: Some cases I was using api keys and didn't put them in a git ignore yet and I didnt want my api keys floating around the web. Another reason is some of the project I have linked were school projects that I would rather not make public to prevent cheating in cases where projects are reused.
